# Introduction

The Premier League is a professional soccer league in England and is the highest level in the English system. The English system runs on a promotion and relegation style. Each season 20 teams fight to stay out of the relegation zone and compete for the Premier League title. Soccer, like any other sport, can be benefited from data analytics.
