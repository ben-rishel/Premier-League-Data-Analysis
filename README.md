# Premier League Data Analysis

This repository contains the code, datasets, and visualizations for our project, "Premier League Data Analysis." This projects explores statistics such as posssession, shot conversion rate, and home-field advantage. We will mainly look at the Premier League but also grab data from the other top European leagues. 

**Access the final results in Premier-League-Data-Analysis.pdf.**

## Overview

In this project we will answer four research questions:

  1. Is home-field advantage real overall? For certain teams?

  2. What are the financial differences across the big 5 leagues? 

  3. Does having a higher possession translate to wins?

  4. Which teams have the best or worst shot conversion rate?

This analysis will provide a deeper meaning of several statistics in the sport of soccer. We will take a closer look on how much each piece of data matter to the teams.


## Repo Structure

The main branch consists of everything you need. The files that end in .R contain the code that answer our four research questions. The qmd is where our final report is being coded. The other branches are used for specific contributors to the project. The one with dev-alven will be Alven's work and updates while dev-ben will be Ben's.
